# Sidekiq::Retries

This subclasses the stock Sidekiq retries middleware to give you some additional options to conditionally retry jobs
irrespective of whether retries are enabled for the job.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'sidekiq-retries'

## Usage

class MyWorker
  include Sidekiq::Worker
  sidekiq_options retry: false # or retry: 25, or the default...

  def perform
    #force a retry even if retry: false using default retry options
    raise Sidekiq::Retries::Retry.new(RuntimeError.new('whatever happened'))

    #force a retry even if retry: false using a specific max_retries
    raise Sidekiq::Retries::Retry.new(RuntimeError.new('whatever happened'), 10)

    #if e.g. retries: true or retries: 10, skip it anyway
    raise Sidekiq::Retries::Fail.new(RuntimeError.new('whatever happened'))
  end
end
